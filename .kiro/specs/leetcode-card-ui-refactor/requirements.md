# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the UI styles of the existing LeetCode card component to improve its visual design, user experience, and maintainability. The current implementation displays LeetCode statistics including problem-solving progress, difficulty breakdowns, and recent submissions in an SVG card format. The refactoring will modernize the visual design while maintaining all existing functionality and improving code organization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the LeetCode card, I want the card to have a modern, visually appealing design that clearly presents my coding statistics, so that it looks professional when displayed on my profile or portfolio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the card is rendered THEN the system SHALL display a modern, clean visual design with improved typography and spacing
2. WHEN the card shows difficulty progress bars THEN the system SHALL use enhanced visual indicators with better color schemes and animations
3. WHEN the card displays the AC circle THEN the system SHALL render it with improved styling including gradient effects and smooth animations
4. WHEN the card shows recent submissions THEN the system SHALL present them with better visual hierarchy and status indicators

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want the styling code to be well-organized and modular, so that it's easier to maintain and extend in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN styling is implemented THEN the system SHALL separate style definitions into logical, reusable components
2. WHEN CSS is generated THEN the system SHALL use consistent naming conventions and proper organization
3. WHEN animations are defined THEN the system SHALL group them logically and make them easily configurable
4. WHEN color schemes are applied THEN the system SHALL use a centralized color management system

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user viewing the LeetCode card, I want smooth, engaging animations that enhance the user experience without being distracting, so that the card feels interactive and polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the card loads THEN the system SHALL animate elements with staggered, smooth transitions
2. WHEN progress indicators are shown THEN the system SHALL animate them from 0 to their target values
3. WHEN hover interactions occur THEN the system SHALL provide subtle feedback animations
4. WHEN animations are disabled THEN the system SHALL respect the disable_animations option and show static content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the refactored card to maintain proper accessibility standards, so that it remains usable with screen readers and other assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the card is rendered THEN the system SHALL maintain proper ARIA labels and accessibility attributes
2. WHEN colors are used THEN the system SHALL ensure sufficient contrast ratios for readability
3. WHEN animations are present THEN the system SHALL respect user preferences for reduced motion
4. WHEN interactive elements exist THEN the system SHALL provide proper focus indicators

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using the card in different contexts, I want the styling to be responsive and adaptable to different themes and customization options, so that it integrates well with various design systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN different themes are applied THEN the system SHALL adapt colors and styling appropriately
2. WHEN custom colors are provided THEN the system SHALL apply them consistently across all elements
3. WHEN the card width is customized THEN the system SHALL maintain proper proportions and layout
4. WHEN border and background options are changed THEN the system SHALL render them correctly with the new styling

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user viewing the card on different devices, I want the visual elements to be crisp and well-proportioned, so that the card looks good across various screen sizes and resolutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the card is displayed THEN the system SHALL use scalable vector graphics that remain crisp at all sizes
2. WHEN text is rendered THEN the system SHALL use appropriate font sizes and weights for optimal readability
3. WHEN spacing is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent proportions across different card sizes
4. WHEN icons and symbols are shown THEN the system SHALL ensure they are properly sized and aligned
